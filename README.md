# MuSCI
An R package with illustrative example implementing multi-source conformal inference under distribution shift

## Installation
To install the latest version of the R package from GitHub, please run following commands in R:

```r
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("yiliu1998/Multi-Source-Conformal")
```

## Usage
An Rmd file for illustration ([click here](https://github.com/yiliu1998/Multi-Source-Conformal/tree/main/vignettes)) is available to download, which gives an example of the use of our package using a simulated dataset. Please run it on your local after you install the package. 

## Contact 
The R code is maintained by Yi Liu (Please feel free to reach out at yi.liu.biostat@gmail.com, if you have any questions).
